<li><b>Vidin</b> - (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Vidin">source</a>) The second Bulgarian Empire collapsed under constant threat from the Byzantines, Hungarians and Mongols, resulting in the break-up of the Empire by the end of the 14th century. However the later weakness of the Bulgarian neighbours ensured that these successor states were never swallowed up.</li>
<li><b>Tarnovo</b> - (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veliko_Tarnovo">source</a>) Possibly the strongest of the successor states to the second Bulgarian Empire.</li>
<li><b>Dobruja</b> - (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Dobruja">source</a>) Another successor state to the second Bulgarian Empire.</li>
