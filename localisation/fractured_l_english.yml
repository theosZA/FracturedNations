 fractured_nations_bookmark_DESC: "The division of England following civil war marked a unique point in history where no nation had any kind of regional power. Only the Holy Roman Empire had any reach and their internal politics ensured no dynasty could really claim the Empire for long. But petty kingdoms in Britain and France; taifas in Andalusia; city states in Italy; and beyliks in Anatolia - they all dream of uniting their realms into great nations that might become one of the leading lights of the known world."

 english_nation_desc: "The English nation that was formed in 1066 by the Normans fell apart in 1444. It has now been reformed under our leadership. A consolidated England puts us among the foremost of European powers. Our growth has become a major factor in promoting our nation's trade and economy, reinforcing our position in world affairs."
 french_nation_desc: "The Assembly of Reims in 987 failed to choose a King of the Franks, resulting in the independent duchies of the north. We have finally re-united the northern duchies and can prepare to bring the southern Franks into the fold as well."
 aquitaine_nation_desc: "We have united the Kingdom of Aquitaine for the first time since the 9th century Frankish wars saw the steady decline and partitioning of the region over the centuries. Our newfound dominance has given us the strength to take the fight to the northern Franks and avenge those old defeats."
 spanish_nation_desc: "The Christian lands of Hispania have been brought together under our leadership. This unity will allow us to fight back against the Moors in the Reconquista."
 andalusian_nation_desc: "Under the Caliphate of Córdoba, Islam was the dominant faith of the Iberian peninsula. The fall of the Caliphate in the 11th century opened the door for the Christians to fight back and re-establish a presence on the peninsula. Now the Muslim lands of Andalusia have been brought together under our leadership. This unity will allow us to fight back and reclaim our past glory."
 italian_nation_desc: "The city states of northern Italy have not been united since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. But now we've successfully brought them all under our control and perhaps the past glory of the Romans will inspite us to create a similar empire."
 naples_nation_desc: "The Normans conquered much of southern Italy from the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century and established the Kingdom of Sicily. Only the Catepanate of Italy held out against the Normans. Centuries later the lands of Southern Italy have been united under our leadership with the flourishing city of Napoli as the nation's heart."
 habsburg_nation_desc: "The Compromise of Vienna divided the Eastern March, but under our leadership we've re-united it and can now be considered a true power of the Holy Roman Empire."
 polish_nation_desc: "Bolesław III divided Poland among his sons in 1138. His succession plan to prevent warfare between the brothers was unsuccessful and this led to more than three centuries of dynastic infighting to claim the Polish throne. We have now succeeded where past generations have failed, and re-united the Polish lands."
 restore_byzantine_empire_desc: "Constantinople fell to the Catholics in 1204 during the fourth Crusade. The Byzantine Empire was disbanded and the Latin Empire took its place. However Byzantine resistance was continued by a number of Byzantine successor states. We've succeeded in uniting these remnants of the Byzantine Empire and can proudly raise the Empire's standard once again."
 persian_nation_desc: "The Persian Empire was mostly overrun by the Mongols in the 13th century. The Mongol Timurid dynasty ruled over Persia in the 14th century, but a series of disastrous wars and poor leaders saw them lose control over their western provinces, including Persia. A number of nations arose and dynasties asserted their claims, but in the end only we can truly claim to be the successor of the once-great Persian Empire."
 irish_nation_desc: "For centuries the petty kingdoms of Ireland have defended themselves from outside forces while fighting among themselves. Now we've established our dominance over the other kings, we claim the title of $MONARCHTITLE$ of All Ireland."
 scottish_nation_desc: "Our influence has been extended across the highlands, lowlands and islands of Scotland. By uniting the Scottish people under our rule, we can better defend ourselves against the foreigners to the south."
 bulgarian_nation_desc: "We have united the Bulgarian people within a single nation."
 romanian_nation_desc: "We have united the Romanian people within a single nation."
 ukrainian_nation_desc: "The lands of Kievan Rus fragmented under pressure from the Mongols in the 13th century. We've succeeded in uniting the southern principalities, the Ruthenian people, into a new nation."
 restore_latin_empire_desc: "Pope Innocent IV reformed the Latin Empire as a Holy Order in 1249 in an attempt to hold back the influence of the Orthodox Greeks. Although the move initially failed to hold back the Byzantine successor states, we have ultimately been successful and risen to become a real power in the region. Now is the time to restore the Latin Empire."
 rhodes_nation_desc: "The Knights Hospitaller were initially based in the Crusader State of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but tension between the religious ambitions of the Order and secular ambitions of the Kingdom saw the Knights exiled to the island of Rhodes. Since that time we have proven our strength and grown our territory. The Grandmaster has reformed many of the structures of the Order and now styles himself as a King to ensure the titles will pass on through his own dynasty."
 form_hanseatic_league_desc: "The Hanseatic League started in Lübeck as a commercial league of merchant guilds that eventually stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea. Some of the individual cities that made up the League were free imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire, others were independent city states and a few remained significant trade ports still subject to a monarch. We've succeeded in consolidating a number of these cities into a single realm where the mercantile principle is held in the highest regard. A series of decrees have now been passed to formalize the establishment of the Hanseatic League, or Hansa, as a sovereign nation."
 fractured_mission_recover_crimea_title: "Recover the Crimean Peninsula"
 fractured_mission_recover_crimea_desc: "The Crimean Peninsula, the historic heart of our nomadic people, has fallen to foreigners and we have no choice but to strike back, reclaim the peninsula and drive the foreigners out."
