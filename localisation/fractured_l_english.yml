 fractured_nations_bookmark_DESC: "The division of England following civil war marked a unique point in history where no nation had any kind of regional power. Only the Holy Roman Empire had any reach and their internal politics ensured no dynasty could really claim the Empire for long. But petty kingdoms in Britain and France; taifas in Andalusia; city states in Italy; and beyliks in Anatolia - they all dream of uniting their realms into great nations that might become one of the leading lights of the known world."
