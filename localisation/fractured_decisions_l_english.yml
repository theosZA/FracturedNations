 french_nation_desc: "The Assembly of Reims in 987 failed to choose a King of the Franks, resulting in the independent duchies of the north. We have finally re-united the northern duchies and can prepare to bring the southern Franks into the fold as well."
 aquitaine_nation_desc: "We have united the Kingdom of Aquitaine for the first time since the 9th century Frankish wars saw the steady decline and partitioning of the region over the centuries.

 restore_byzantine_empire_desc: "Constantinople fell to the Catholics in 1204 during the fourth Crusade. The Byzantine Empire was disbanded and the Latin Empire took its place. However Byzantine resistance was continued by a number of Byzantine successor states. We've succeeded in uniting these remnants of the Byzantine Empire and can proudly raise the Empire's standard once again."
 persian_nation_desc: "The Persian Empire was mostly overrun by the Mongols in the 13th century. The Mongol Timurid dynasty ruled over Persia in the 14th century, but a series of disastrous wars and poor leaders saw them lose control over their western provinces, including Persia. A number of nations arose and dynasties asserted their claims, but in the end only we can truly claim to be the successor of the once-great Persian Empire."

Now is the time to restore the Latin Empire."
 rhodes_nation_desc: "The Knights Hospitaller were initially based in the Crusader State of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but tension between the religious ambitions of the Order and secular ambitions of the Kingdom saw the Knights exiled to the island of Rhodes. Since that time we have proven our strength and grown our territory. The Grandmaster has reformed many of the structures of the Order and now styles himself as a King to ensure the titles will pass on through his own dynasty."
 form_hanseatic_league_desc: "The Hanseatic League started in Lübeck as a commercial league of merchant guilds that eventually stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea. Some of the individual cities that made up the League were free imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire, others were independent city states and a few remained significant trade ports still subject to a monarch. We've succeeded in consolidating a number of these cities into a single realm where the mercantile principle is held in the highest regard. A series of decrees have now been passed to formalize the establishment of the Hanseatic League, or Hansa, as a sovereign nation."
